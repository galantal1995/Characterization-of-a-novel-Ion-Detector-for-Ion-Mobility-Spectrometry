# Characterization-of-a-novel-Ion-Detector-for-Ion-Mobility-Spectrometry

Achievements:

- Design and development of an automated Corona Discharge ion source (High voltage power supply) to generate multiple charged ions for the characterization of the CMOS ion detector.
- Verification of the developed test system by reference measurements with the use of a sensitive electrometer amplifier.
- Controlling of the detector readout electronics and performing data collection and analysis with Python programming language. The developed software also includes an interactive visualization tool.
- Characterization of Sensitivity, Instrument Detection Limit, Dynamic Range and Noise sources of the detector with respect to the different design variants integrated into the chip.
- Development of a peak position detection algorithm for detecting single ion pulses in Ion Mobility Spectrometry (Digital data processing, filtering and convolution of signal in Python).
